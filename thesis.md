## Introduction

We are, as inhabitants in the modern world, being continuously bombarded by news and other
information. As concerned citizens, we try to weed through this vast amount of data in
order to become better informed about the issues of current social and personal
interest. Today, we accomplish this goal by watching network news broadcasts, listening to
the radio, reading one or several of the various printed forms of media generally
published daily or weekly, or by word of mouth from friends and acquaintances. Each of
these methods of communication has its advantages and disadvantages, but none of them is
(comprehensively) adequate to do the job required today of information retrieval,
communication, and dissemination.

* Television news brings us up to the minute pictures and visual information, and along
  with Radio carries current news and stories.

* Newspapers and magazines generally can give a broader perspective,or perhaps a more
  detailed, although often personally biased, view.

* Libraries provide an excellent way to access printed media, and offer the user the
  advantage of being able to access past as well as current information.

* Word of mouth is still the most powerful method of communication available to us, but it
  is heavily restricted by the number of people we come into contact with, and the
  generally limited scope of world and cultural interest available in an average person's
  circle of friends.

I say that word of mouth is powerful mainly because it is generally the best method of
quickly and accurately conveying ideas. This is so because of the immediate feedback that
one receives from a listener, and because of the *two-way* path of the communication
that exists and is conspicuously absent from the other methods of
communication/information retrieval mentioned above.

This thesis proposes the development of a new form of information retrieval which
incorporates hopefully the best of all the possible avenues of communication. It would
consist of a personal computer of fair to substantial power connected over some
communication channel (telephone lines, light guides, satellite) to electronic libraries,
schools, shopping centers, banks, and other users, as well as, of course, entertainment
stations. In essence, it would be an extension of both the television set and the
telephone, facilitating a bi-directional interchange of data. Such a system could be
called an *HCS*, or *Home Communication Set*, a term coined by John Wicklein, the current
president of the Public Broadcasting Network, in his book *Electronic Nightmare*.

Recently, the philosophy of system design has been changing along with new advances of
technology that are serving to dramatically lower the cost and space requirements of
computing power. An awareness of the need to supply user flexibility without tying up
channels of communication with redundant or simply useless information has helped pave the
way for the current dogma of distributed processing. This concept incorporates a small,
perhaps personal computer with user needs built in, or better, specified by the user, and
a clear, quick, and precise communication protocol between it and other computers which
are connected to it through a network. This allows the user to be in control of the way
she is interacting with the system, and thus gain confidence and efficiency in its use.

Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly economically productive for a company to compile
and provide to the consumer large databases of information, such as news, weather, legal
codes, or even classroom instruction. This last is made possible, and the others more
useful, due to the bi-directional transmission capabilities of the system. This exciting
prospect, that of being able to transmit a reply to an article or make a statement on an
issue, as well as receive information from a greater variety of sources, will help to open
up a whole new world of learning and information.

However, a tool which can provide unlimited access to informational resources can be used
as well as terribly abused. To insure that malicious misuse of such a system is kept to a
minimum without placing undue and possibly dangerous restrictions on how it is to be used,
there are several important issues which should be kept in mind during the design of a
large scale integrated system.

* The user interface must be easy to use, comprehensible, and easily customized to user
  preference. It must also be low cost and available to all.

* Access to public information must be guaranteed to all. No one should be denied access
  due to reasons of class, race, political beliefs, sex, et cetera.

* Private information, e.g., personal letters sent by means of an electronic mail, must be
  guaranteed private and untappable. \[note: This can be accomplished using current,
  state-of-the-art public key encryption methods.\]

* No single interest group, such as the government, military, or private corporation,
  should have the ability to control the flow of information on the system, or have any
  influence upon what is and what is not generally available.

All of these guidelines should be completely adhered to or we lay ourselves bare to
manipulation and exploitation for the good of some special interest group. As people begin
to learn how to use the system for learning and dissemination of information, and with
these precepts as a foundation, we will be able to move towards a better informed public,
decentralization of decision making, and perhaps a more coherent public policy along
socially useful lines.

## Media Technology

This thesis describes the design and implementation of an interface between a person
wishing to become more informed about some subject and a large computer-indexed database
of news and legal information. The interface has been implemented at the Architecture
Machine Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in a generalized fashion so as
to allow easy extensibility and user customization. One of its goals has been to seemingly
increase the bandwidth of the communication channel by providing an "intelligent"
interface which can store the intermediate results of a path of inquiry or automatically
extend it, and by providing automatic (keyword) access to an optical videodisc which will
have a large number of high-resolution color photographs, charts, and maps which are
displayed in mixed format along with quality (two-bit font) text. Another goal, as with
all systems designed at Arch Mac, is total ease of use, achieved through integrated use of
color monitors with touch sensitive displays, two-way voice communication, and other
human-oriented input and output (communication) methods.

The database that we have interfaced to is a high-technology keyword access information
retrieval system provided by Mead Data Corporation.  It contains on the order of a
trillion characters of text in original format drawn from the three major domestic wire
services, major domestic and Japanese papers and magazines, (with the notable exception of
the New York Times) a plethora of legal case reports, and the entire Encyclopedia
Britannica. Their system is relatively pleasant to use with their standard terminal, but
it lacks pictures and the generality to connect to other users or data banks. Also, in
general, it has a very formalized set of commands, and thus lacks the flexibility we are
striving for.

An important feature of the interface is the ability to comment on (or even annotate a
personal copy of) an article that one feels strongly about, and then mail it to one's
friends. An extension of this which is incorporated in my system is the ability to store
annotations on the Mead Computer so that anyone interested can access them. In essence,
guaranteeing that one's "letter to the editor" is published. This feature is the first
step toward decentralization of information -- a desirable goal in this new age of
information.

The first and most important design consideration is that the system have complete two-way
communication capability. This allows for an interactive, building approach to information
retrieval where one makes a generalized request for information, gets feedback in the form
of text and/or graphics, and is then able to, on the basis of this, continue the line of
inquiry deeper by describing a more specific search goal or by modifying the current
request in order to explore a new avenue of thought.

This is accomplished through the use of an interactive touch-sensitive display, a computer
controlled videodisc system, and other state-of-the-art interactive technologies, such as
voice recognition and speech production, gesture amplification, contextual modification,
and (yes, Martha) a keyboard.

Suppose one wishes to find out the cost of carrying cargo on future space shuttle
flights. First one selects a library to draw upon. With the LEXIS/NEXIS system supplied by
Mead Data Central (MDC), we might decide to restrict our search to "WIRES" which is a
combination of stories carried by AP, UPI, and REUTERS wire services. Restriction of
libraries to search will save time and money, for every story found will carry a surcharge
on both. Then one enters the general goal, say, "Space Shuttle and cargo" from a
keyboard and the computer "answers" by displaying on the monitor the first page of text
from the most recent addition to the selected library, and at the bottom will be a command
area which will tell the user that she is at the first of (say) 37 stories found, and
where she can ask to see the next or previous page or story, to modify or quit from the
search, or to move to a different search keeping recent information in a temporary storage
cache.

Now, as one browses through the first few stories, we find one which mentions "consumer
costs" and "touch" this phrase which informs the system to restrict the search to
stories which have this key in them also. By iterating this approach, one finally arrives
at a concise search stratagem, which is useful if perchance our selected library falls
short of satisfying our curiosity. At such a point, we can simply broaden our horizons by
including other libraries to search from.

A nice feature made available because of the power of one's personal HCS is the storage
of search topics. If one runs short on time, or just wishes to be kept up to date on some
topic, a search strategy can easily be stored, and re-entered at a later date. This could,
for the case of being kept up to date, even be done automatically by the HCS every day,
such that when one wished to find out "what's new," the information is already waiting.

An extension of the idea of carrying over search topics lies on the
field of research, which would become a hobby of anyone who has access
to an HCS (which eventually should become guaranteed by law to everyone,
see below). Once fully integrated, with many private and public
libraries online, one could hopefully find out just about "anything
about anything," but it would take time not only to learn where to
search (i.e., who has the information) but also what exactly it is that
one is interested in. It would be quite an interesting, and rewarding
learning experience.

## NewsPeek System Overview

Communications between the user, the Nexis daemon, and MDC's LEXIS/NEXIS, usually occur
as various other routines in the system operations upon one or more of four segment-sized
data bases \[see [Appendix A](#appendix-a-nexis-daemon-database)\]. Two of them, `nexsuper` and `nexinput` are 'owned' by the
Nexis daemon which has total impunity in their usage. They are also initiated by the
user-controlled `nex$` routines, which write to `nexsuper` to inform the daemon of user
presence or to initiate a search, and reads from `nexinput` when the daemon signals that a
page is ready to be read.

Every user has her own copies of the other two, `nex_user` and `nex_page`, are the user's
sole property, and describe the current state of the user's line of inquiry and act as an
intermediate buffer for page information as received by the daemon, respectively. As one
can see by a cursory inspection, `nex_page` and ``nexinput`` are very similar, and are indeed
somewhat redundant, for proper usage dictates - that a page in `nex_page` be allocated by
the user process before a request for information be made, so it would seem easiest for
the daemon to write directly into `nex_page` as data comes in. But this would require that
the daemon have every user's instance of `nex_page` initiated, number of users to a
maximum of around five, limiting the because of the restrictions MagicSix imposes on the
number of segments which can be initiated in an address space. So when a page (in
`nexinput`) is filled, the daemon signals the user that her page is ready, and the user, who
has `nexinput` initialized (there is only one) copies it into her own `nex_page` buffer using
`nex$save_page` or `nex$mangle`.

There are three major parts to the design of the interface:

1. The Hardware. This consists of an auto-dialer to make the link with Mead Data Central's
   (MDC) LEXIS/NEXIS system, and a half-duplex RS-232C (standard) interface to one of the
   Architecture Machine Group's Interdata 3220 or 3230 computers running the MagicSix
   Operating System.

2. The Nexis daemon and I/O buffers. A special free-running process known around MIT as a
   daemon) has been designed to handle the allocation of communication, i.e. telephone,
   lines, buffering, formatting and transmitting of user requests (queuing them until a
   free line can be found) buffering returned page information, and signalling the
   appropriate user when a reply is complete and ready to be copied into the user
   space. The Nexis daemon utilizes two special segment sized shared databases to aid in
   interprocess communication.

3. The NewsPeek user interface. NewsPeek is a generic term for a series of programs to
   facilitate comfortable user interactions. It is within the domain of NewsPeek to handle
   the formatting of an output display (with or without videodisk supplied images), the
   interpretation of data gathered from a touch sensitive display, and other user
   interfaces.

As the system now stands, NewsPeek has only a minimum of functionality, but is designed in
a modular, object oriented manner such as to make the addition of new features as
straightforward as possible.

A rather large collection of routines exists for communicating intent from NewsPeek to the
Nexis daemon. These are known within the system as '`nex$`' routines, and one exists for
every command that can be entered from a standard LEXIS/NEXIS terminal (transmitting),
along with a smaller collection for inspecting and modifying the daemon's state (inquiry),
as when a new user enters into communication with the system.  \[See [Appendix B](#appendix-b-nexis-daemon-documentation)\]
\[important note: The user should NEVER attempt to touch the daemon databases `nexsuper` or `nexinput` other than through the use of `nex$` routines.\]

An important feature of `nex$` routines is that they may be used in either of several
fashions, according to personal preference and efficiency requirements. The various
formats of a 'transmitting' `nex$` routine are as follows:

----
```
     dcl  nex$transmit entry options (variable)
  1) call nex$transmit (uname, xid, "foo")
  2) call nex$transmit (uname, xid, "foo", rid)
  3) call nex$transmit (uname, xid, "foo", page_num, rid)
  or
     dcl  nex$transmit entry options (variable ) returns (fix)
  4)  rid=nex$transmit (uname, xid, "foo")
  5)  rid=nex$transmit (uname, xid, "foo", page_num)

  [where uname is the user's name,
           xit is the transmit id,
         "foo" is the search request,
      page_num is an index into the user's page buffers, and
           rid is the temporally unique request id.]
```
----

Method 1 is the simplest to use, but does not return 'rid', which acts like a general code
in that if negative, something went wrong. The 'rid' (`request_id`) is the user's handle as
to where the Nexis daemon is buffering her requests, and in fact may be used to help
identify a particular search. However, use of `$save_that_page` and `$mangle` (used to
either save or kill a page on the signal '`bufr_rdy`') preempts the need for the user to
have to worry about rid's value. Many find it comfortable to have the code's reassurance
that all went well with the last operation, though.

Methods 2 and 4 are thus slightly safer, and when rid is positive, it points to the entry
in `nexsuper.xbuf` which is buffering the request.

Each of these methods (1, 2, and 4) assume that the user does not want to save the
returned page, although the daemon will still signal '`bufr_rdy`' to the user when it is
done.

\[note: calling `nex$dont_bother` will keep the daemon from signalling the user if she is
not interested. Call `nex$bother_me` will reset this, and is the default\]

If, however, the user is interested, she should subsequently call `nex$save_that_page`
(abbreviated '`$stp`') with an index into the `nex_page` buffers as an argument.
Alternatively, she could use methods 3 or 5 which accept a `page_number` as part of the
original call. If the `page_number` is less than or equal to zero on the call, the page is
not of interest and will not be buffered; otherwise, a call to `nex$mangle` will save it
in the right spot.

 
## Nexis Daemon Interface

Use of the daemon increases the potential performance of MDC's LEXIS/NEXIS system in
several ways. First of all, it allows type ahead, for it buffers all input and output
requests. This also allows for multiple users on a single system, although if only one
line were active performance would degrade considerably.

Another important feature is that we will no longer be tied to a standard text
terminal. Instead, we will display results of searches on a color monitor, in quality,
two-bit fonts, with key words highlighted in color. A touch sensitive display will provide
direct control over moving through stories, or expanding or compressing the scope of the
search. Other I/O techniques will also be explored in future work, such as voice (using
the NEC voice recognition device and the votrax talker), gesture, and contextual
specification.

Multiple lines can be accessed at once so that parallel searches can be made on different
databases. For example, we will soon be installing an AP picture description database in
an MIT private file at MDC. Then, when we make a request for a story about, say, Kissinger
and Iran, we will simultaneously access the AP database which will return the frame
numbers of a map of Iran and a recent photo of Henry Kissinger on a AP videodisc. Thus,
the final display of a particular search might well be a collage of text provided by NEXIS
and graphics provided by a local computer controlled videodisc system. \[See graphic, next
page.\]

## Nexis Variable Descriptions

Each variable in the database is commented, but some deserve further explanation.

The first thing to note is that each is based on a `linkage$foo` external pointer; that
is, each database has its pointer made an external static variable, so that variables
within it may be referenced without having to refer to its pointer. This is possible
because there is at most one instance of any of these data bases in a process.

Looking at `nexsuper` first, note that the database is organized into four main sections
which correspond, respectively, to a table of user information, statistics of id number
usage, phone numbers and other related stream information, and the circular transmit
buffer and its associated control variables.

* `ulock bit(32)`
* `ilock bit(32)`
* `llock bit(32)`
* `xlock bit(32)`

Each of these sections has a read/write lock which is used before any process (other than
the daemon) can write to its associated section.

* `max_xxxs fix`
* `xxx_count fix`

Each of the first three sections has its maximum size set by `Ninit` (the Nexis daemon's
initialization procedure) and `xxx_count` reflects the number of `xxx`'s currently active.

The first section in `nexsuper` is the user information area which keeps track of who is
logged into the system. It also contains fields which allow for easy user access to the
`nexinput` page buffers.

* `user[<unum>J.ridx fix`

The `ridx(request_id)` is used by the daemon and the user to keep track of pending
requests. When a user initiates a request, it goes into the next available spot in the
transmit buffer (`xbuf`, see below) and its index is returned as the `request_id`. When the
daemon finishes reading in a page of information, it checks `user[<unum>].ridx`. If it is
negative (which implies that no buffers are pending) we set it to the page's `ridx`, which
was set when the page was allocated, and then '`signal user[<unum>].name "bufr_rdy"`'
which alerts the user to the fact that a page is ready to be read.

* `user.[<unum>J.crid fix`

Used by `nex$mangle` is set to the "current" `rid` which corresponds to the `xbuf` entry whose
input is ready to be read by the user.

* `user[<unum>].bother bit(1)`

This is, by default, set to true. What this variable controls is whether or not the user
wishes to be signalled that a page has been received even if the user is not interested,
(i.e., not planning on saving the page).

The id numbers and records of the user comprise the second section of data in
`nexsuper`. One hundred id numbers are used so that multiple search contents can be saved
while moving from one contour to another, or while multiplexing users along a single
telephone line. Most of these are self explanatory, but additional clarification may be
helpful with a few.

* `id[<inum\].in\_use bit(64)`

This is set to all zeros when the id is freed by a user. Other than that, it contains the
time, in `bit(64)` format, of when this id was last used.

The third section is the phone number list. In a future version of this system, MDC will
supply us with a dedicated 9600 baud trunk line which we will then time-demultiplex into
up to 16 separate 1200 baud lines. In this manner we could run parallel searches, one of
the major advantages of this system. The values stored under `line[lnum]` are generally
self-explanatory, except for `io_ptr`, `ioname`, `device`, `devptr`, and `handle` which
are used by the daemon and MagicSix to facilitate I/O stream communication.

The final and most critical section of `nexsuper`, is the `xbuf` (transmit buffer) and its
associated control variables.

* `xlock bit(32)`

Another write lock used by the `nex$` routines to insure that only one process writes to
the buffer at a time.

* `xsize fix`

`xsize` is set to 255, which thus allows 256 entries in `xbuf`, for it starts at zero.

note: `xsize` should always be a power of two minus one.

* `xmask bit(8)`

This is used to aid in modulo (xsize) addition. It is defined on xsize and is ANDed with
`xhead` or `xtail` when these are incremented. Thus `xbuf` is a circular buffer. Note that,
because based storage cannot use the "defined" attribute, `xmask` is actually commented out
and is defined in programs that use it. The same holds for

* `xhack defined xhead`
* `xtack defined xtail`
* `xcack defined xcidx`
   * `xhead fix`
   * `xtail fix`
   * `xcidx fix`

These point to the head, tail, and current index of the transmit buffer, respectively.

* `xhwrp bit(1)`
* `xtwrp bit(1)`

These flags are (were) used to inform the daemon of wrap around, but are currently not
used.

* `xbuf[0:1]`

The transmit buffer `xbuf` is dynamically allocated. On MagicSix, one cannot define a
segment over 16k bytes in size, but dynamic allocation can go to 64k. So `xbuf` is defined
here of size two, but it will grow to xsize (255)

* `dserved bit(1)`

`dserved` is not used in the current version of the Nexis daemon. However, it will provide
the control necessary to implement intelligent look-ahead in search request serving. What
this means is, in a fully implemented system with multiple lines to MDC, one might wish to
skip the lowest (oldest) available request to transmit so that another may be transmitted
on the current id, for increased efficiency. `dserved` would then let the daemon know
whether or not a particular entry has been served.

* `uname char(8)vary`
* `u_num fix`
* `command char(128)vary`

These are all set by the `nex$` routine so the daemon knows what to do and for whom.

* `idnum fix`

`idnum`, also known as the `xid` (`transmit_id`) is also provided by the `nex$` routine, and is
a number from 1 to `max_ids` that points to the id number to use.

* `ipage fix`

`ipage` points to the page in which to save results of a search.
* If `ipage=0`, then the user is not interested.
* If `ipage<0` then the page is full and ready to be read.

## Appendix B: Nexis Daemon Documentation

This is the documentation for the Nexis daemon which comprises the heart of the NewsPeek
NEXIS/MagicSix interface.

The Nexis daemon is composed of five subprograms which live in `>dd>Nexis>source` and are
bound together in `>dd>Nexis>Nexis`. The top-level program is called Ndaemon.pll, and is
very simple indeed. On being run (or launched) the daemon first calls `$Ninit` which sets
up the two daemon data bases (`nexsuper` and `nexinit`, see [Appendix C](#appendix-c-notes-on-nex---the-low-level-user-interface-to-nexis)), and initializes the
structures within. Then a (deferred) sleep condition "`XInit_sig`" is set to wake only
after control passes to a catnap statement in the top level, and when the two values
'`xhead`' and '`xtail`', which point to the top and bottom respectively of the `xbuf` queue, are
not equal, signifying that there is something in the queue to transmit. Next, several
condition handlers are passed over, setting them up, so that the daemon can gracefully
handle mail or other messages sent to it, and can properly clean up on logout.

At this point the daemon goes to sleep. In general, at this point one would signal
"`nio_make`" on the daemon which would cause a Nexis stream to be initialized (using
`$make_nio`) with its own wakeup handler watching it for changes in the input buffer. To
kill a line, such as at the end of a session, `$free_nio` is used.

The two last routines, `$proc_recv` and `$proc_xmit` are called when there is something in
the input or output buffers respectively.  `$proc_recv` strips off MDC characters `SOM`
and `ETX` along with the two final `LRC` characters. \[note: all transmission in either
direction with MDC end with the `LRC`, or Longitudinal Redundancy Check, characters. What
they amount to is a running exclusive OR of all characters in the transmission, and they
give a fairly good check on the accuracy of a transmission.\] On receipt of the `ETX`, the
condition "`bufr_rdy`" is signalled on the querying user, unless the user has not
displayed interest in the page (see below), and has previously called `nex$dont_bother`.

`$proc_xmit` gets a "best choice" free line and transmit_id number and sends the bottom
request to MDC. If the user displays interest in the request, either by including a page
number in the request or through calling `nex$stp`, the daemon will also allocate a page in
`nexinput`.

## Appendix C: Notes on nex - the low level user interface to NEXIS

### Overview

`nex` is a rather largish binding of all sorts of useful entries to a user of the Nexis /
MagicSix information / communication NewsPeek interface.  It contains two basic types of
entries -- those which involve direct communication to MDC (generally through a certain
amount of buffering provided by the Nexis daemon), and those which simply make inquiries
(or requests) concerning the status of the daemon's state, such as asking that a buffered
input page from MDC be written into the users page_buffer area.

`nex` routines touch three of the four major databases which are used in the NewsPeek
system. By touching `nexsuper`, `nex` requests can login or logout a user, can allocate
and free MDC id numbers, and can place information to be transmitted to MDC in
`xbuf`. `nex$save_page` copies an input page from `nexinput` to `nex_page`, the user's
page buffer area.

The entries `$login`, `$logout`, `$get_xid` (that's `get_transmit_id`), `$free_xid`,
`$what_rid`, `$save_page`, and `$kill_page` communicate information between the user and
the NEXIS daemon and do not involve MDC (i. e. the NEXIS system). Most of the other
entries correspond to commands that can be given at a NEXIS terminal. (For an explanation
of MDC NEXIS and its commands, see the NEXIS manual.)

`nex` routines cause the appropriate command to be sent to MDC and may also cause certain
other things to happen in order to maintain a consistency within the NEXIS daemon
(e.g. `nex$abort`). All logging in and out with MDC will be handled by the NEXIS daemon,
although the user must log in and out from the daemon. The user must get at least one
`NEXIS_id` (although one - per active contour is reasonable) from `nex$get_xid`. A valid
`NEXIS_id` must be passed with each request to MDC. Users should relinquish a `NEXIS_id`
(use `nex$free_xid`) when they no longer require it (e.g. when deactivating the current
contour or preparing to logout from the NEXIS daemon). In any case `nex$logout` will free
any of the user's `NEXIS_ids` not already freed by the user.

### Notes on implementation

`nex` has a fairly smart command parser, in that it can accept integer arguments in
character form (as from a command line) and it will convert them to integer form and check
for bounds errors before executing the command. String inputs (for transmission to MDC)
can be char(anything)varying, but `nex` will signal an error and not process the command if
it is longer than 128 characters, or contains non-printing characters.

### Argument conventions

All `nex` commands take a user_name as the first argument, and most (transmitting)
commands require a valid `xid` (`transmit_id`) as the second. All `nex` commands return a
`fix(15)` number, which, if negative, indicates an error and signals the user that the
last command was not processed. If an error is indicated, any side-effects caused
(perpetrated?) by the command previous to the error's detection will be undone. In
general, however, the returned number will be an `rid`.  Exceptions are `$login`,
`$logout`, etc, which simple return a `fix(15) code = 0` if all goes well, and `$get_xid`
which returns (what else?) a `xid`.

### Declarations

```
dcl uname char(B) vary,             /* user name */
    xid   fix,                      /* transmit id (O <= xid <= 255) */
    rid   fix,                      /* request id (1 <= rid <= 100) */
    code  fix;                      /* NOT fix(31). Generally the routines
                                       return the xid, which basically IS the
                                       code. Or the rid. If the returned value
                                       is negative, an error has occurred. */
```

### Simple usage

A generic user session with MagicSix/Nexis would begin with a call to `nex$login`, which
takes the `user_name` and returns a negative code only if the user is already logged in, or
the system is full. Then, a call to `nex$get_xid` will get a free (if any) `id_number` to use
in calls to the various transmit functions.

Note: The user should store the `xid` (`transmit_id`) in a safe place (such as in
`nex_user.contour[ccontour].id_number_used`) for all requests made in this line of inquiry
(which I call a *contour*) should be accompanied by this number. The system re-allocates
old id numbers by time since last used, so there is some real possibility that, if the
system has not been too heavily used, your id number may still be yours the next day,
which will significantly reduce search resumption time.

Note two: The `xid` should not be confused with the `rid` (`request_id`) which is returned
from a call to `nex$what_rid` and other queueing transmit functions. This call is made
after the condition `bufr_rdy` is signalled upon the user's process, signifying that a
complete input_page is ready to be read. The `request_id` is a temporally unique number
which describes (physically) the `xbuf` location used for some pending transmission to
MDC, and should be, again, carefully saved by the user if she wishes to read the returned
output from the command. It is returned by all `nex$foo` routines which queue on
`nexsuper.xbuf`, such as `nex$transmit` and `nex$chg_lib`.

Before the user makes her first request to MDC's NEXIS, she should set up a `bufr_rdy`
condition handler which is guaranteed to call either `nex$save_page` or `nex$kill_page`,
after, of course, calling `nex$what_rid`. This is required, for as input pages are buffered
by the daemon in a single segment, there is only room for about 32 of them, and the daemon
will cease to transmit requests until there is room for the returned output. Both
`nex$save_page` and `$kill_page` free the input buffer for reuse.

When the user is finished with her session, a call to `nex$logout` is executed. This
cleans up the database, and removes the user from the Nexis user-ring.

 

Appendix D: Terminology
-----------------------

For the purposes of these notes the following definitions apply:

* A **contour** is a state of NewsPeek and, by implication, of the MDC NEXIS system. To
  NEXIS, each contour is equivalent to a single user at a NEXIS terminal. As a coherent
  area of activity, a contour can be said to be a *personality* of the user.
   * An **active contour** is one for which the user has obtained a `NEXIS_id` and, hence,
     can issue requests to MDC NEXIS.
   * The **current contour** is the one on which the user is currently working
     (e.g. issuing a request).
   * A **dormant contour** is one which is not **active**.
* A **request** is a request to the MDC NEXIS system (i.e. NOT call to `nex$login`,
  `$what_rid`, etc.).
* **Current requests** are those of which the NEXIS daemon is currently aware. A **current
   request** (uniquely identified by its `rid`) is current between the time `nex$foo_request`
   is called and the time the user calls `$save_page` or `$kill_page`. Being **current** in NO
   WAY implies that either the NEXIS daemon or MDC is currently working on said request.
