## Preface

While an undergrad at M.I.T., I became aware of the ignorance, apathy and powerlessness expressed and/or felt by much of the society, and decided to do something about it. Perhaps due to the fact that I was so immersed in the process of learning my intial plan was to educate the world.

There was folly and perhaps a bit of hubris in this idea, partly because much of the world often appears not to desire further education, but more importantly, a single source of information could easily devolve into fascism.

While pondering what to do for an interdisciplinary thesis melding concepts from the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and the Architecture Machine Group (now called the Arts and Media Technology Center, or the _Media Lab_, for short) I came to the realization that providing high quality information to those willing to seek it out (I called such people teachers) would be a key step in my original goal.

Further, the definition of high quality information should be up to the informed choice of each individual consumer. The entire publishing system was going to have to be turned upside down, and as a first step towards this I created a personal newspaper called _NewsPeek_ and designed and built its initial hardware and software as my undergraduate thesis in 1981.

_NewsPeek_ combined the seemingly limitless information resources of Mead Data Corporation's Nexis online news service with large-scale personal computing, artificial intelligence and advanced communications and networking to produce an electronic newspaper which contains high quality news, information and entertainment individualized by and for the user.

## Acknowlegements

This thesis was not created in a vacuum but rather at the M.I.T. Architecture Machine Group, an inter-disciplinary multi-media laboratory extending the reach of computers into people's lives for the first time. Arch Mac's director, Nicholas Negroponte, Walter Bender, then a graduate student and later the executive director of the Media Lab, and Andrew Lippman, a professor focusing on the future of TV while I was focusing on the future of the newspaper, all provided encouragement and pushed me to explore the edges. Without their support and the fertile atmosphere they created within the walls of Arch Mac, _NewsPeek_ would not have been created.

I also drew ideas and methodologies from my work at the M.I.T. Artificial Intelligence Lab, and from interactions with its professors including Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert, Gerry Sussman, Carl Hewitt and Richard Stallman among many others. The AI Lab was an awsome place in the late seventies and I was fortunate to be a part of it.

Finally, special thanks to Rocky Grober for typing by thesis as I scribbled it down on paper.

## Why two dates?

The _NewsPeek_ concept, hardware and software interfaces to power it, and this thesis were all created in the 1980-1981 year culminating in its completion in August 1981. The author left the thesis in his advisor's office and left for a planned six-to-nine month job in California after which his plan was to return to complete the work as part of a graduate degree. But the California job - and the weather and experiences - were enticing so the task of following up on the degree slid to the back burner.

Many years later in 2018 I began the process of getting my already fully written thesis signed. Anne Hunter, Academic Administrator for the EECS Undergraduate and M.Eng. Programs provided invaluable assistance in tracking down decades old course records and graduation requirements, and I was doubly fortunate that Andy Lippman remembered me and my work and offered to read the old text and sign it. He gave me an "A" and wrote: _"A prescient project, well one and overdue for appreciation"_.
